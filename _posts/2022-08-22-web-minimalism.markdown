<b>Web Minimalism</b> is simplifing the web interface for end users. Its an approach to website UI design that places emphasis on clarity, purpose, functionality and intentionality over adding features that provide little benefit. Everything else is removed; popups, trackers, banners or anything else that could increase cognitive overhead for end users. Given that a large proportion of the web is serving static content, usually blogs or articles, a large proportion of the modern web could be simplified. This is best shown visually, so I've included some examples below to explain what I mean along with some principals of UX that I think are very important.

<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>Data Engineer with +6 years of experience working in industries such as telecommunications, telematics and semi-state/government bodies. My interests include building data pipelines, experimenting with new automation tools and trying to keep up with never ending stream of cloud based data transformation tools/platforms.</p> 


<p>Advocate of <b>web minimalism</b>. Modern websites are a bloated mess of trackers, popups and advertisements (not to mention the pain of GDPR popups for those of us in the EU). Most websites are a pain to visit, a return to simple intuitive UI's is required. Hence, this website. </p>

<br>

<h3>Skill Stack</h3>

<p>Tools/languages that I have the most experience with:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Database Technologies - Teradata, Postgres.
 <li>Teradata Tools & Utilities - (TTU) bteq, fastload, mload and fastexport tools for building data pipelines ontop of Teradata.
 <li>SQL - Procedural SQL, Functions and triggers.
 <li>Bash/korne shell - Unix shell scripting including core utilities such as sed, grep, gawk, cut, paste etc.
	 <li>Linux Administration - Certified <a href="https://rhtapps.redhat.com/verify?certId=210-010-765">RHCSA</a>.
 <li>Python scripting 
 <li>Apache Airflow - Scheduler and orchestrator.
 <li>Apache Spark - Developing pyspark jobs for batch or streaming.
 <li>CI/CD - I prefer using a stack like circleci, docker, Artifactory and github for version control.
 <li>AWS - I'm familar with a lot of the core services on AWS, too many to list here. I've used EMR for running pyspark workloads, and EKS for deploying container microservices, for example.
</ul>

<p>Tools/languages that I'm currently trying to learn:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Github Actions - I'm familar with the basics but I'd like to use this a lot more.
	 <li>Google cloud platform - I'm certified as a Data engineering professional on <a href="https://www.credential.net/585ad471-0ada-465f-affa-b7e98309f939?key=0148acc1ae83bc2870f900f972a99913cfa7e0c63ef2fb56b9309e0e591b6d0b">GCP</a> but I've never really built anything substantial on GCP yet.
 <li>Scala - Seems to be getting more popular amongst spark developers. In terms of performance, it seems to scale better than python and makes uses of type inference to make development easier.
</ul>

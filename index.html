<h3>Bulma Clean Theme</h3>

<p>This is a jekyll based static website hosted in github. I've decided to go with the <b>Bulma Clean Theme</b> developed by C.S Rhymes. A link to his personal website can be found <a href="https://www.csrhymes.com/">here</a> or at the bottom of each page. If you would like to install this theme for yourself you should visit the <a href="https://www.csrhymes.com/bulma-clean-theme/docs/">documentation</a>.</p>
